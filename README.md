<h3>Features Implemented</h3>
<b>Responsive Design</b>
The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices.
<b>Navigation</b>

Implemented a navigation bar with dropdown menus for easy navigation through different sections.
<b>Interactive Elements</b>

Utilized JavaScript for interactive elements such as sliders, carousels, and modal windows to enhance user experience.
<b>Animations with GSAP</b>

GSAP was integrated to add sophisticated animations to key elements of the website. Below is an example snippet:

```javascript
// Example GSAP animation snippet
gsap.from('.hero', {
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 1,
  y: -50,
  ease: 'power2.out',
  delay: 0.5
});
```
<h3>Smooth Scrolling with Locomotive Scroll
</h3>
Locomotive Scroll was implemented to achieve smooth scrolling behavior across the website:

```javascript
// Initialize Locomotive Scroll
const locoScroll = new LocomotiveScroll({
  el: document.querySelector('.smooth-scroll-container'),
  smooth: true
});
```


<h3>Canvas Features
</h3>
Canvas was used for creating interactive graphics or animations. Below is an example snippet:
```javascript
// Example Canvas animation snippet
const canvas = document.querySelector('#myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Drawing code here
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)';
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);
```
